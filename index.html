		<h2>The Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program</h2>
			<p>
				Whether you simply want to visit <a href="https://www.immigratemanitoba.com">Manitoba</a> to explore our rich cultural history and natural beauty, come to Manitoba to work temporarily or immigrate to our province through one of the available options, including the world-renowned Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program, in this section you will find everything you need to know to be successful.
			</p>
			<h3>Skilled Worker Stream</h3>
			<p>
			The Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP) seeks recent graduates, skilled workers, businesspeople and their families with the intention and ability to successfully settle and economically establish in Manitoba as permanent residents. Manitoba makes it easy to immigrate and settle in our province.

			The MPNP for Skilled Workers is locally driven and based on the needs of Manitoba employers. We select internationally trained and experienced workers who have the skills needed in the local labour market, and nominate them to receive Canadian permanent resident visas to settle and work in Manitoba. There are two streams:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<a href="http://www.immigratemanitoba.com/immigrate-to-manitoba/swm/"><li>Skilled Workers in Manitoba</li></a>
				<a href="http://www.immigratemanitoba.com/immigrate-to-manitoba/swo/"><li>Skilled Workers Overseas</li></a>
			</ul>

			<h3>International Education Stream</h3>
			<p>
			The new International Education Stream (IES) for Manitoba graduates is dedicated to providing international students graduating in Manitoba and meeting the needs of industry faster pathways to nomination.
			There are three pathways:
